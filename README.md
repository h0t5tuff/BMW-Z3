Simply I wanted to open my BMW Z3 door from my phone via bluetooth, or use my fingerprint. here's thte code. just make sure u use a chip with a hard serial UART because I use that for the finger print sensor. The bluetooth module is connected via a soft serial UART. I could have used two soft serials for this but it doesn't seem worth it
